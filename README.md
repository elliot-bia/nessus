# 说明/Readme
这个破解原本是自用的，也没打算公开出来    
但是昨天在使用fahai破解版awvs的时候，看到了这么一句话：  
`Thank's fahai && Open Source Enthusiast `

于是我就在思考，我用了那么多开源项目，那我又做出了多少贡献？    
索性将此项目公开，也算为网安做一点贡献    
如果没有意外，会持续更新，毕竟我也要用    
就不把自动更新插件版本弄出来了，先用着吧！  

The original intention of the project is in the spirit of open source    
We can do a little things for open source, for the world!

# Note/Readme

This crack was originally used, and I didn't plan to make it public  
But when I used the FAHAI cracked version of AWVS yesterday, I saw such a sentence:  
`Thank's Fahai && Open Source ENTHUSIAST`  
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40572216/174698816-440d4969-f9d6-4c7d-982c-9af9c4a3e875.png" width = "400" height = "200" alt="图片名称" align=center />
 
So I was thinking, I used so many open source projects, how many contributions did I make?  
I simply disclose this project, which can also be considered a little contribution to the Internet security  
If there is no accident, it will continue to be updated, after all, I also need to use  
Don't get the automatic update plug -in version, use it first!

# Update log/changes

In fact, in addition to the above decryption, there is another very simple way to let everyone dig
